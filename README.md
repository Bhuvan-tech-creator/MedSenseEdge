    # Step 1: Search for PubMed IDs
    search_url = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi"
    
    # Step 2: Fetch detailed article information
    fetch_url = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi"
    
    # Returns structured data with title, abstract, journal, authors, PMID
```

### **EndlessMedical Enhanced Integration**
```python
def set_endlessmedical_features(features_dict):
    """Enhanced EndlessMedical integration with multiple endpoint testing"""
    possible_base_urls = [
        f"https://{rapidapi_host}",
        f"https://{rapidapi_host}/v1/dx", 
        f"https://api.endlessmedical.com/v1/dx"
    ]
    
    # Try each endpoint until one works
    for base_url in possible_base_urls:
        # Comprehensive error handling for each attempt
